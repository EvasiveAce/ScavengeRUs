The database is flawed for this project, and should be refactored in an industry level team. We could not, but we tried to make do with what we have. 
Access codes are a big issue as well, we wanted the phone number to be the access code, but it is a bit more complicated than we had time for.

Some advice when planning: if you think a task is sprintable, break it down even more. Your estimation skills are likely low to nonexistant, shorter tasks will make it easier to complete and show more progress.

Lastly, follow the agile principles and don't do extra work if it's not needed. Make your backlog to your needs. If your team needs more, make more, but if they don't, don't.
